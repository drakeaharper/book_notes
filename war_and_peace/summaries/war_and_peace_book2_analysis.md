## Summary of Key Events in Book 2

### **Historical Context**
Book 2 covers the period from late 1805 into early 1806, focusing on the early stages of the War of the Third Coalition against Napoleon. The action moves between the battlefields of Austria and the drawing rooms of Moscow and Petersburg.

### **Key Events and Character Developments**

**1. The Campaign Begins**
- Russian armies march to support Austria against Napoleon
- Prince Andrei serves as aide-de-camp to General Kutuzov
- Nikolai Rostov experiences his first military campaign as a hussar officer
- The contrast between military theory and battlefield reality becomes apparent

**2. Major Military Actions**

**The Ulm Campaign**
- Austrian General Mack is surrounded and forced to surrender at Ulm
- This disaster leaves the Russian army isolated and retreating
- Kutuzov begins his famous strategic withdrawal to avoid destruction

**The Battle of Schöngrabern**
- Prince Bagration conducts a brilliant rearguard action to cover the Russian retreat
- Nikolai Rostov experiences his first real combat
- The reality of war contrasts sharply with romantic notions of military glory
- Russian forces successfully delay the French advance

**3. Character Development Through War**

**Prince Andrei's Military Experience**
- Serves closely with Kutuzov, observing high-level strategy
- Becomes disillusioned with military bureaucracy and court politics
- Witnesses the gap between battle plans and battlefield chaos
- His search for meaning and glory becomes more complex as he sees war's reality

**Nikolai Rostov's Coming of Age**
- Transforms from eager young patriot to experienced soldier
- Experiences fear, confusion, and the brotherhood of arms
- Gets wounded in action, learning about physical courage and vulnerability
- His idealistic view of war becomes tempered by experience
- Develops deep loyalty to his regiment and fellow officers like Denisov

**4. Domestic Dramas**

**Pierre's Disastrous Marriage**
- Falls into Prince Vasily's trap and marries Helene Kuragina
- The marriage is loveless and based entirely on manipulation
- Pierre's wealth makes him a target, but his naivety makes him vulnerable
- Helene proves to be beautiful but morally empty and possibly unfaithful
- Pierre begins associating with Dolokhov and other dissolute characters

**The Rostov Household**
- Family struggles financially while trying to maintain appearances
- Natasha, now 14-15, begins to develop romantic feelings
- Her childhood attachment to Boris Drubetskoy becomes more serious
- Count Rostov's financial carelessness becomes more apparent
- Sonya remains faithful to Nikolai despite his absence

**Vera's Marriage**
- Vera Rostov marries Berg, a German officer, in a calculated match
- Their relationship represents marriage without love or passion
- Contrasts with the genuine emotions of other family members

**5. The Bolkonsky Estate**
- Old Prince Bolkonsky maintains rigid discipline while worrying about his son
- Princess Marya lives in religious devotion and care for her pregnant sister-in-law
- Lise (the "little princess") becomes increasingly anxious about her pregnancy and husband's absence
- The estate represents old Russian values under pressure from modern European influences

**6. Society and Politics**
- Moscow and Petersburg society continues its round of parties and gossip
- The war becomes a topic of fashionable conversation rather than real concern
- Anna Pavlovna's salon reflects changing political winds
- Marriage politics continue as families jockey for advantageous connections

### **Major Themes Developed**

**War vs. Romantic Idealism**
- The gap between romantic notions of military glory and war's brutal reality
- Young men like Nikolai and Andrei confront the difference between expectation and experience
- Kutuzov represents practical wisdom versus theoretical military science

**Authenticity vs. Artificiality**
- Pierre's marriage represents the triumph of social manipulation over genuine feeling
- The contrast between battlefield brotherhood and salon politics
- Natural family bonds (Rostovs) versus calculated relationships (Kuragins)

**Individual Growth Through Suffering**
- Characters develop through hardship: Nikolai through combat, Pierre through marital disillusionment
- The search for meaning becomes more urgent as comfortable illusions are stripped away

**Social Class and Marriage**
- Marriage as economic transaction rather than emotional union
- The vulnerability of wealth without wisdom (Pierre's situation)
- The pressure on families to maintain social position despite financial strain

### **Narrative Structure**
Book 2 masterfully alternates between intimate domestic scenes and sweeping military campaigns. Tolstoy shows how historical events affect individual lives while personal dramas continue regardless of external circumstances. The book builds toward the climactic Battle of Austerlitz, with characters positioned for major transformations.

The war scenes establish Tolstoy's revolutionary approach to depicting battle - not as glorious spectacle but as confused, frightening, and morally ambiguous human experience. Meanwhile, the domestic scenes show how social pressures and personal weaknesses can be as destructive as enemy armies.
