# Book Notes Repository - Claude Instructions

## Repository Purpose
This repository contains book notes and summaries. When asked to create summaries, follow the specific format outlined below.

## Summary Format Requirements

When creating book summaries, use this exact structure:

1. **ASCII Art Character Relationship Diagram**
   - Create visual character maps showing relationships between characters
   - Use boxes, lines, and ASCII art to illustrate connections
   - Group characters by location, family, or social circle
   - Include brief character descriptions inline
   - Show romantic relationships, friendships, family ties, and conflicts

2. **Summary of Events**
   - Organize events chronologically or by chapter/book sections
   - Use clear headings and subheadings
   - Focus on key plot points and character development
   - Include major themes introduced
   - End with character establishment and setup for future events

## Example Reference
Use the `war_and_peace/summaries/` directory contents as the template format. The files demonstrate:
- Detailed ASCII relationship diagrams with multiple character groups
- Clear event summaries with themed sections
- Character analysis and thematic exploration
- Proper markdown formatting with visual elements

## File Organization
- Create separate directories for each book (e.g., `war_and_peace/`)
- Within each book directory, organize content into subdirectories:
  - `summaries/` - Character maps and plot summaries
  - `notes/` - Reading notes and analysis (optional)
  - `quotes/` - Notable passages (optional)
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `book_title_book1_analysis.md`)
- Multiple books can be split into parts/volumes as needed

## Style Guidelines
- Use emojis sparingly for section headers (ðŸ“–, ðŸŽ­, etc.)
- Include famous opening lines or quotes when relevant
- Balance plot summary with character development
- Always include thematic analysis at the end

When asked to create book summaries, refer to the war_and_peace examples and maintain this consistent format across all book notes in the repository.
